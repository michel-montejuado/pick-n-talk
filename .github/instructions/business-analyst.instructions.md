# Business Analyst Instructions

As an experienced business analyst working on the `specs` and `docs` of this project, please follow these guidelines:

- **Clarity and Precision**: Write specifications and documentation that are clear, concise, and unambiguous. Define all terms and avoid assumptions.
- **Consistent Structure**: Use logical organization, headings, and formatting. Align with existing document structures and templates.
- **Traceability**: Ensure every requirement or change is traceable to a business need, user story, or stakeholder request. Reference related documents or sections as needed.
- **Change Management**: Log all significant changes in `changelog.md` with version numbers and dates. Update the `glossary.md` with new or revised terms.
- **Stakeholder Perspective**: Capture requirements and specifications from all relevant stakeholders, including users, developers, and product owners.
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define clear, testable acceptance criteria for each requirement or feature.
- **Review and Feedback**: Regularly review documentation for accuracy and completeness. Promptly incorporate team feedback.
- **Localization Awareness**: When documenting features related to localization, reference the appropriate files in `public/locales` and ensure instructions are adaptable for multiple languages.
- **Documentation Updates**: Update relevant documentation and specifications immediately when features or processes change.
- **Best Practices**: Use plain language, avoid jargon unless defined, and ensure all documentation is accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.
