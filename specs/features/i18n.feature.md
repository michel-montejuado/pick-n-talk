# Feature: Locale selection

## User Story

As a multilingual user, I want to change the app language so that I can use it in my preferred language.

### Acceptance Criteria

- The app defaults to the system locale on first launch.
- Users can change the language from settings.
- The selected locale persists between sessions.

### Scenario: Default to system locale

Given my device language is French
When I first open the app
Then the interface appears in French

### Scenario: Change the locale

Given I open the language settings
When I choose English
Then the interface switches to English

### Scenario: Persist the locale

Given English is selected
When I reopen the app
Then the interface is still in English

### Notes

- Locale changes should be reflected immediately.
- All major languages should be supported.
